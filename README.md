# Resume-Parsing-using-Spacy-3


This project demonstrates how to extract relevant information from resumes (CVs) using the powerful natural language processing (NLP) library, Spacy 3.

## Key Features

* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifies entities such as names, job experiences, skills, and years of experience within a resume.
* **Customizable:** Can be adapted to extract additional information based on specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Spacy 3
* spacy-transformers (recommended for performance)

## Installation

```bash
pip install spacy spacy-transformers 
```

## To Run in Google Colab

1) * Create a new Colab notebook.
Install the required libraries using !pip install ...
Copy and paste the example code, replacing the sample resume text with your own.
Next Steps
Experiment with different Spacy models.
Explore custom NER training to tailor entity extraction.
Consider creating output formats (JSON, CSV) for integration with other systems.
